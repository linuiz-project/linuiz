/*
 * Generation of ACPICA with MS Visual Studio 2017
 */
Last update 28 May 2020.


The Visual Studio project file (for Visual Studio 2017)
appears in this directory:

    generate/msvc2017/AcpiComponents.sln

ACPICA generates with all MS C language extensions disabled, since the
code is ANSI conformant and is meant to be highly portable.
